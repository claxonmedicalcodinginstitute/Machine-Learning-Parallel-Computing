# ⚡ Machine Learning & Parallel Computing (MLPC)

This repository contains both major assessments completed for the **Machine Learning & Parallel Computing (ITS66604)** module. 

Across these projects, I explored the foundations of **supercomputing**, **GPU architecture**, **parallel processing**, and **machine learning workflows**, applying them to real-world analytical tasks.

The repository includes:
- 🖥 **High-Performance Computing (HPC) Supercomputer Analysis**
- 🤖 **Machine Learning Classification Project (Weather Extreme Detection)**
